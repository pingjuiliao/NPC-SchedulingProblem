#  Comment from Mike
- This looks like a reasonable project topic. It looks related to *bin-packing*. I think the most natural kinds of instances will be easy. I expect that only a narrow class of instances will be hard, and you should try to identify these classes and explore them.

- It looks like you have a LOT of work still to finish. I don’t have a lot of information here that I can use to give feedback. In the final version, I will be interested in the following questions: 
	1. What exactly is the **definition** of the problem you are solving? (“scheduling” is not specific enough) 
	2. What are the inputs and criteria for the final answer? You have the beginning of a description of how this problem is converted into SAT, but it should be expanded. 
	3. What is the overall structure/architecture of your implementation? 
	4. What is the relationship between **input size** (various dimensions/parameters of the inputs) and formula size and running time? 
	5. Where will you find/generate sample data? 
	6. Will you evaluate on both yes and no instances of the problem? 
	7. How does the cost of the solver scale with input size of the problem? 
	8. What is the limit of feasible inputs that can be solved with this method?
